Comunica is a highly modular and flexible query engine platform for the Web.

As Comunica is a query engine _platform_,
various configurations can be built for it,
each leading to a different query engine.
One example of such a configuration is [Comunica SPARQL](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/actor-init-sparql),
which is an engine that is preconfigured to execute SPARQL queries over heterogeneous interfaces.

This repository should be used by Comunica module **developers** as it contains multiple Comunica modules that can be composed.
This repository is managed as a [monorepo](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md)
using [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/).

If you want to **use** Comunica, have a look at the [manual](http://comunica.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
or at [Comunica SPARQL](https://github.com/comunica/comunica/tree/master/packages/actor-init-sparql)
if you want to execute SPARQL queries.

## Development Setup

This project can be setup by cloning and installing it as follows:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:comunica/comunica
$ cd comunica
$ yarn install
```

This will install the dependencies of all modules, and bootstrap the Lerna monorepo.

Furthermore, this will add [pre-commit hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pre-commit)
to build, lint and test.
These hooks can temporarily be disabled at your own risk by adding the `-n` flag to the commit command.
